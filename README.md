# Password-Generator
When providing temporary passwords to users, it is not ideal to provide every user with the same password. This program solves that problem by providing words until the total characters is 8 or more characters and then adds a number. This solution is currently being implemented by my IT department. 

To install, download the Setup.exe file along with the msi file. Make sure the Words.txt file is included in the same folder as the 
main application after the install. The current configuration only supports Windows 10.

To edit, download the whole repository and open the solution (.sln) file to open the solution in Visual Studio.
